# Hansol AIO Dashboard

Hansol AIO Dashboard is an open source dashboard for displaying and monitoring logged data from [Hansol AIO Photovoltaik devices](https://myess.hansoltechnics.com/prod/prod.do#1). 

It's based on [SB Admin 2](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/), an open source admin dashboard theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

-   [Fork, Clone, or Download on GitHub](https://github.com/Xembalo/hansol-aio-dashboard)

## Preparation and Installation

The Hansol AIO device is accessible via the local network and provides diagnostic data. These can be read out cyclically via a script.
In this project there is an example script in the folder `additional/collect_data` which should be executed every minute in a Linux environment (Raspberry Pi, Synology NAS or similar) via crontab. 
The results are written into a MySQL/MariaDB with a time stamp and can then be read or further processed.
You can also use the phyton script stand alone or in docker enviroment to collect data and push it to MariaDB or MQTT/Home Assistant.

The script to create the database tables is located in the folder `additional/database`

## Usage

Download or clone the repo to a PHP and MySQL/MariaDB enabled webserver of your choice. For database access PDO is used. You need to modify the file `includes\config.inc.php.sample` and rename it to `includes\config.inc.php`. 

Navigate your browser of choice to your project, thats it!
